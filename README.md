## Vibe / AI-assisted Development Experience

I regularly use AI-assisted and no-code tools such as Lovable, Cursor, and low-code platforms to accelerate development. I have used them to prototype dashboards, internal tools, and MVPs quickly before migrating to production-ready React and backend systems.

In my workflow, I use AI tools primarily for:
- Rapid scaffolding of components
- Exploring architecture options
- Refactoring and improving code quality
- Writing initial SQL schemas and iterating on them

I treat these tools as accelerators, while ensuring final implementations follow clean, scalable engineering practices.

## AI Stack & Tools

I have experience working with OpenAI APIs (chat and embeddings), vector databases, and prompt-based workflows. I have used embeddings for semantic search and content recommendations, and integrated AI features into full-stack applications using React frontends and Supabase/Firebase backends.

I focus on keeping AI integrations modular, observable, and easy to iterate on as models evolve.
